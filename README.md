"In the dataset I give, try to predict y based on X. Instead of going deep, try something simple and sweet. For the dataset at hand, being accurate is not an aim. Since accuracy is not the thing you seek, data visualization should do the trick! I hope this task brings you pleasure, but make sure to share the treasure! And one more thing, don't worry you'll overfit!"
